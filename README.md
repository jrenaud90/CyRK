**Runge-Kutta ODE Integrator Implemented in Cython and Numba**

CyRK provides fast integration tools to solve systems of ODEs using an adaptive time stepping scheme. CyRK can accept differential equation functions 
that are written in pure Python or njited numba, speeding up development time. The purpose of this package is to provide some 
functionality of [scipy's solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) with improved performance.

Currently, CyRK's [numba](https://numba.discourse.group/) (njit-safe) implementation is 10-100x faster than scipy's solve_ivp function. 
The [cython](https://cython.org/) implementation is 5-30x faster. The cython function is also largely pre-compiled which avoids most of the 
initial performance hit found with using the numba version.

## Installation

It is recommended you use an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) environment. CyRK has been tested on Python 3.8--3.10

To install simply open a terminal and call:

`pip install CyRK`

If not installing from a wheel, CyRK will attempt to install `Cython` and `Numpy` in order to compile the cython code. 
After the files have been compiled, cython will be uninstalled and CyRK's runtime dependencies 
(see the pyproject.toml file for the latest list) will be installed instead.

A new installation of CyRK can be tested quickly by running the following from a python console.
```python
from CyRK import test_cyrk, test_nbrk
test_cyrk()
# You will hopefully see the message "CyRK's cyrk_ode was tested successfully."
test_nbrk()
# You will hopefully see the message "CyRK's nbrk_ode was tested successfully."
```

### Installation Troubleshooting

*Please [report](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues) installation issues. We will work on a fix and/or add workaround information here.*

- If you see a "Can not load module: CyRK.cy" or similar error then the cython extensions likely did not compile during installation. Try running `pip install CyRK --no-binary="CyRK"` 
to force python to recompile the cython extensions locally (rather than via a prebuilt wheel).
- On MacOS: If you run into problems installing CyRK then reinstall using the verbose flag (`pip install -v .`) to look at the installation log. If you see an error that looks like "clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'" then you may have a problem with your `llvm` or `libomp` libraries. It is recommended that you install CyRK in an anaconda environment with the following packages `conda install numpy scipy cython llvm-openmp`. See more discussion [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers/issues/157) and the steps taken [here](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/blob/main/.github/workflows/push_tests_mac.yml).

### Development and Testing Dependencies

If you intend to work on CyRK's code base you will want to install the following dependencies in order to run CyRK's
test suite.

`conda install pytest scipy matplotlib jupyter`

`conda install` can be replaced with `pip install` if you prefer.

## Using CyRK
CyRK's API is similar to SciPy's solve_ivp function. A differential equation can be defined in python such as:

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import njit
# For even more speed up you can use numba's njit to compile the diffeq
@njit
def diffeq_nb(t, y):
    dy = np.empty_like(y)
    dy[0] = (1. - 0.01 * y[1]) * y[0]
    dy[1] = (0.02 * y[0] - 1.) * y[1]
    return dy

initial_conds = np.asarray((20., 20.), dtype=np.complex128)
time_span = (0., 50.)
rtol = 1.0e-7
atol = 1.0e-8
```

The ODE can then be solved using the numba function by calling CyRK's `nbrk_ode`:

```python
from CyRK import nbrk_ode
time_domain, y_results, success, message = \
    nbrk_ode(diffeq_nb, time_span, initial_conds, rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol)
```

To call the cython version of the integrator you need to slightly edit the differential equation so that it does not
return the derivative. Instead, the output is passed as an input argument (a np.ndarray) to the function. 

```python
@njit
def diffeq_cy(t, y, dy):
    dy[0] = (1. - 0.01 * y[1]) * y[0]
    dy[1] = (0.02 * y[0] - 1.) * y[1]
```

Alternatively, you can use CyRK's conversion helper functions to automatically convert between numba/scipy and cyrk
function calls.

```python
from CyRK import nb2cy, cy2nb

@njit
def diffeq_nb(t, y):
    dy = np.empty_like(y)
    dy[0] = (1. - 0.01 * y[1]) * y[0]
    dy[1] = (0.02 * y[0] - 1.) * y[1]
    return dy

diffeq_cy = nb2cy(diffeq_nb, use_njit=True)
diffeq_nb2 = cy2nb(diffeq_cy, use_njit=True)
```

You can then call the ODE solver in a similar fashion as the numba version.

```python
from CyRK import cyrk_ode
time_domain, y_results, success, message = \
    cyrk_ode(diffeq_cy, time_span, initial_conds, rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol)
```

### Optional Inputs

Both the numba and cython versions of the ODE solver have the following optional inputs:
- `rtol`: Relative Tolerance (default is 1.0e-6).
- `atol`: Absolute Tolerance (default is 1.0e-8).
- `max_step`: Maximum step size (default is +infinity).
- `first_step`: Initial step size (default is 0).
  - If 0, then the solver will try to determine an ideal value.
- `args`: Python tuple of additional arguments passed to the `diffeq`.
- `t_eval`: Both solvers uses an adaptive time stepping protocol based on the recent error at each step. This results in
a final non-uniform time domain of variable size. If the user would like the results at specific time steps then 
they can provide a np.ndarray array at the desired steps to `t_eval`.
The solver will then interpolate the results to fit this array.
- `rk_method`: Runge-Kutta method (default is 1; all of these methods are based off of
[SciPy implementations](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)):
  - `0` - "RK23" Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 3(2).
  - `1` - "RK45" Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4).
  - `2` - "DOP853" Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8.
- `capture_extra` and `interpolate_extra`: CyRK has the capability of capturing additional parameters during integration. Please see `Documentation\Extra Output.md` for more details.

### Limitations and Known Issues

- [Issue 1](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues/1): Absolute tolerance can only be passed as a single value
(same for all y's).
