# Capturing Extra Output with CyRK's ODE Solvers

It can be advantageous to capture additional output parameters during the integration of systems of ordinary differential equations.
Particularly when the differential equations in question are computationally expensive. For example, consider the following simplified differential equation.

```python

def diffeq(t, y, a, b):
    
    # Some complicated function of time and y_1; this may be calling many other inner functions.
    f = calculate_f(t, y[1])
    
    # Calculate dy/dt
    dy_0 = f * a * y[0] + b * y[1]
    dy_1 = b * y[1] 
    
    return np.asarray([dy_0, dy_1])
```

Using CyRK it is easy to integrate this function to find `y_0` and `y_1` as a function of time.
But suppose that in our final analysis we also want to see how `f` is changing with time and `y`s. We could extract it by using `y_0` and `dy_0` (which we would have to calculate), 
but the more complicated the relationship the harder this is to do and will require additional computations and code.
An easier solution would be to make separate calls to `calculate_f` for our new `y` and `t`, but again this requires additional computations which may be expensive.
In this case `calculate_f` will be called _twice_ for each value in the time domain (once for the initial integration and once to find the value of `f` afterwards). 

Instead, it would be ideal if we could just store the value of `f` during integration since it is already being calculated during the solving process.

CyRK offers this functionality at the expense of a small hit on performance when using this feature.
The values of these extra parameters are not analyzed by the solver when determining the adaptive step size or numerical error handling.

## Limitations

Current limitations of this feature as of v0.4.0:
- Only numerical parameters can be used as extra outputs (no strings or booleans).
- All extra outputs must have the same _type_ as the input `y`s. This means if you are using `y`s which are floats, but you need to capture a complex number, 
then you will either need to change the `y`s to complex-valued (with a zero imaginary portion) or, a better option, return the real and imaginary portions of the extra parameter separately.

## How to use with `CyRK.nbrk_ode` (Numba-based)

Define a differential equation function with the additional extra outputs put _after_ the y-derivatives.
It is a good idea to turn the output into numpy ndarray before the final return.

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import njit

@njit
def diffeq(t, y, arg_0, arg_1):
    
    extra_parameter_0 = arg_0 * y[0] * np.sin(arg_1 * t)
    extra_parameter_1 = arg_0 * y[0] * np.cos(arg_1 * t - y[1])
    dy_0 = extra_parameter_0
    dy_1 = np.acos(extra_parameter_1)
    
    return np.asarray([dy_0, dy_1, extra_parameter_0, extra_parameter_1], dtype=y.dtype)
```

Call the `nbrk_ode` solver in the standard form except now with the `capture_extra` flag to `True` (by default it is `False`).

```python
from CyRK import nbrk_ode
time_domain, all_output, success, message = \
    nbrk_ode(diffeq, time_span, initial_conds, rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol, capture_extra=True)
```

The output of the solver (if successful) will now contain both the dependent `y` values over time as well as the extra parameters.

```python
y_0 = all_output[0, :]
y_1 = all_output[1, :]
extra_parameter_0 = all_output[2, :]
extra_parameter_1 = all_output[3, :]
```

## How to use with `CyRK.cyrk_ode` (Cython-based)

The process for capturing extra outputs with the cython-based solver follows similar steps to the numba-based approach discussed above with two exceptions.

First, as is the case with the general solving method, the differential equation signature for `cyrk_ode` requires the output to be given as an input.
Otherwise, the same rules apply here as they did with the numba version: extra outputs must come after the `dy/dt`s, and they must have the same type (TODO: for `cyrk_ode` as of v0.4.0 the type has to be complex).

```python
def diffeq_cy(t, y, output, arg_0, arg_1):
    
    extra_0 = (1. - arg_0 * y[1])
    extra_1 = (arg_1 * y[0] - 1.)
    output[0] = extra_0 * y[0]
    output[1] = extra_1 * y[1]
    output[2] = extra_0
    output[3] = extra_1
```

The next change is that the solver needs to know how many extra outputs it should expect. In our example there are two additional outputs.

```python
from CyRK import cyrk_ode
time_domain, all_output, success, message = \
    cyrk_ode(diffeq_cy, time_span, initial_conds, rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol, capture_extra=True, num_extra=2)
```

The output matches the output described for the numba-based approach,

```python
y_0 = all_output[0, :]
y_1 = all_output[1, :]
extra_parameter_0 = all_output[2, :]
extra_parameter_1 = all_output[3, :]
```

## How to use with `CySolver` (Cython-based)

The process to extract extra outputs is straight forward when using the cython-based cdef class. First, as described in the readme.md, you must create a new sub class that defines the diffeq. Note the following code must be made in a .pyx file, cythonized, and compiled. After that it can be imported and used in a regular python file.

```cython
"""ODE.pyx"""
# distutils: language = c++
# cython: boundscheck=False, wraparound=False, nonecheck=False, cdivision=True, initializedcheck=False
from CyRK.cy.cysolver cimport CySolver
# Note the `cimport` here^

cdef class CySolverTester(CySolver):

    @cython.exceptval(check=False)
    cdef void diffeq(self):
        
        # Unpack dependent variables using the `self.y_new_view` variable.
        cdef double y0, y1
        y0 = self.y_new_view[0]
        y1 = self.y_new_view[1]

        # If needed, unpack the time variable using `self.t_new`
        cdef double t
        t = self.t_new

        # Unpack any additional arguments that do not change with time using the `self.arg_array_view` variable.
        cdef double a, b
        # These must be float64s
        a  = self.arg_array_view[0]
        b  = self.arg_array_view[1]

        # Define extra variables that you are interested in storing and accessing later.
        cdef double extra_0, extra_1
        # These extra parameters must be float64s
        extra_0 = (1. - a * y1)
        extra_1 = (b * y0 - 1.)
        # These are then stored in the self.
        self.extra_output_view[0] = extra_0
        self.extra_output_view[0] = extra_1

        # This function must set the dydt variable `self.dy_new_view`
        self.dy_new_view[0] = extra_0 * y0
        self.dy_new_view[1] = extra_1 * y1
```

Once you compile the differential equation it can be imported in a regular python file and used in a similar fashion to the other integrators.

```python
"""run.py"""
from CyRK.cy.cysolvertest import CySolverTester

# Need to make an instance of the integrator.
# We need to tell the solver how many extra outputs we want to capture. In this case, 2.
CySolverTesterInst = CySolverTester(time_span, initial_conds, args=(0.01, 0.02),
                                    rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol,
                                    num_extra=2, interpolate_extra=False)

# To perform the integration make a call to the solve method.
CySolverTesterInst.solve()

# Once complete, you can access the results via...
CySolverTesterInst.success     # True / False
CySolverTesterInst.message     # Note about integration
CySolverTesterInst.solution_t  # Time domain
CySolverTesterInst.solution_y  # y dependent variables

# Extra output that was captured during integration.
CySolverTesterInst.extra
print(CySolverTesterInst.extra[0, :])
print(CySolverTesterInst.extra[1, :])
```

## Additional Considerations When Using `t_eval`

_This is applicable to either the numba- or cython-based solver._

By setting the `t_eval` argument for either the `nbrk_ode` or `cyrk_ode` solver, an interpolation will occur at the end of integration.
This uses the solved `y`s and `time_domain` to find a new reduced `y_reduced` at `t_eval` intervals using `numpy.interp` function. 
Since we are potentially storing extra parameters during integration, we need to tell the solvers how to handle any potential interpolation on these new parameters.

- **Option 1**: Solve for the extra parameters at the new interpolated `y` values
  - _How to set_: Set `t_eval` to the desired numpy array, set `capture_extra=True`, and `interpolate_extra=False`.
  - Pros:
    - Less information is stored during integration which can reduce memory usage, especially when an integration requires many steps.
    - Results are more accurate since all the interpolation error is only in `y`, extra parameters are as correct as `y` (no compounding interpolation error).
  - Cons:
    - Additional calls to the `diffeq` are made after integration is completed (number of calls `= len(t_eval)`). If this function is computationally expensive then this will slow down overall solver time.
- **Option 2**: Store extra parameters during integration and then perform interpolation on both `y` and all extra parameters.
  - _How to set_: Set `t_eval` to the desired numpy array, set `capture_extra=True`, and `interpolate_extra=True`.
  - Pros:
    - No additional calls to `diffeq` are made. This could improve performance if this is a particularly expensive function.
  - Mixed:
    - The same amount of information is stored during integration as if `t_eval` were not set in the first place. This can have a negative impact on memory and performance depending on the number of extra parameters and the number of integration steps.
  - Cons:
    - Results may be less accurate because the extra parameters are interpolated _independent_ of `y`'s interpolation. Parameters that depend on `y` may no longer match expectations, particularly when `y` is changing quickly. For example, if an extra output is defined as `x = y[0] * 2.0`, then at some time `t` where `y[0]` was interpolated to be 5.0, `x` may differ from its definition (we expect it to be equal to 10.0): `x(t) = 9.8`.
    - More call(s) to `numpy.interp` will be made (once for each extra parameter) this may have a negative impact on performance, particularly for many extra parameters.
